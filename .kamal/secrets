# Secrets for Kamal deployment

# Docker registry credentials
DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN=$DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN

# NOTE (amiller68): in order to make secrets to be visible to your deploy
#  scripts, you need to register them here AND make sure they are exported
#  by ./bin/kamal
# That is, ./bin/kamal will handle making sure everything required from your configured
#  vault is available to the deployment environment, kamal just requires you to also export them
#  here for anything that can't or shouldn't be represented as plain text

# Example:
# MY_SECRET=$MY_SECRET

# ts/next
QUOTIENT_PRIVATE_API_KEY=$QUOTIENT_PRIVATE_API_KEY

# py
GOOGLE_O_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_O_AUTH_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_O_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=$GOOGLE_O_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
